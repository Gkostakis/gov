ECO.SYSTEM.OS

A browser-based, force-directed network diagram and relationship mapping tool.

No build step. No server. No installation. Open in any browser.

What It Is

ECO.SYSTEM.OS is a single-file, zero-dependency web application for creating, visualising, and navigating relationship networks — nodes connected by directed links, simulated with D3.js physics. It runs entirely in the browser with no backend required.

Use it to map teams, systems, processes, recipes, concepts, dependencies, knowledge graphs, organisations, or any network of interconnected entities.

Quickstart

1. Download index.html
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Click + Node to start building — or Import a saved .json file

That's it.

Features

Network Editing
- Add nodes with name, type, status, importance (1–100), color, tags, notes, and custom key-value properties
- Create directed links between nodes with optional relationship labels
- Drag nodes freely on the canvas; pin them in place
- Double-click or right-click a node to open the editor
- Delete nodes with single-step undo (Ctrl+Z)

Visualisation
- Force-directed layout — nodes simulate physical repulsion and link attraction via D3.js
- 3D Force Graph — full 3D WebGL view
- Importance Rings — concentric ring layout grouping nodes by importance tier
- Animated link particles — directional flow along every link (toggle pause/play with the Links button)
- Node shapes — filled circles, outline circles, or cards (rectangles)
- Color by Type — assigns distinct colours per node type
- Canvas background — custom colour picker

Properties Panel
- Click any node to inspect type, status, importance, tags, notes, custom properties, and connections
- Navigate between Properties / Index / Tags / Stats tabs
- Index tab ranks all nodes by importance and connection count
- Stats tab shows graph metrics, pie charts, and most-connected nodes

Search & Filter
- Inline search bar — dims non-matching nodes in real time
- Ctrl+K Quick Switcher — keyboard-navigable node search overlay
- Filter bar — filter by type, status, tag, or orphan nodes

Save & Load
- Save as JSON — full portable graph export
- Save as SVG — vector export of the 2D canvas
- Browser storage — auto-saves to localStorage; manual save/load supported
- Drag & drop — drop any .json file onto the canvas to import

Data Format

JSON files follow this structure. The _schema key is optional — it is stripped on import and can be used to embed documentation or universal diagram rules alongside your data.

{
  "_schema": { },
  "version": "1.041",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1a2b3c4",
      "name": "Node Name",
      "type": "System",
      "status": "Active",
      "importance": 75,
      "color": "#2203ff",
      "owners": ["Alice"],
      "tags": ["core"],
      "notes": "One-sentence qualitative note.",
      "linksOut": ["n5d6e7f8"],
      "linksIn": [],
      "custom": [{ "key": "Version", "val": "2.1" }],
      "linkMeta": { "n5d6e7f8": { "label": "depends on" } },
      "pinned": false,
      "updatedAt": "2026-03-05T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "links": [],
  "customTypes": ["Dish", "Process", "Ingredient"],
  "customStatuses": []
}


Key rules:
- nodes is the source of truth. links is always rebuilt from linksOut on import — do not hand-craft it.
- importance maps to visual node size: 1 → 8px radius, 100 → 58px. Spread the full range intentionally.
- linksOut holds IDs of nodes this node governs or flows into. linksIn is derived automatically.
- customTypes and customStatuses are merged with the app defaults on import.

Universal Diagram Structure

ECO.SYSTEM.OS works for any domain using a consistent 4-tier model:
Tier	Role	Importance	linksIn
0 · Root	The central thesis, product, or entity	100	[]
1 · Components	Major pillars or subsystems	60–95	[root_id]
2 · Processes	Transformations, methods, workflows	40–92	[component_id]
3 · Atoms	Irreducible elements — ingredients, people, tasks, sources	1–100	[process_id]

This maps to any domain:

Recipe    →  dish       → ingredient group  → cooking method  → ingredient
Org       →  company    → department        → workflow        → person / role
Project   →  goal       → milestone         → task            → asset / file
System    →  product    → module            → function        → dependency
Essay     →  thesis     → argument          → evidence        → source
